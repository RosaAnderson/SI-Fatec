**I have spent fifteen days in Serra da Canastra. I have looked for the Brazilian merganser every day. It has been difficult, but I have enjoyed the experience. During these days, I have taken pictures of many birds. I have also seen some wild animals, such as the maned wolf and the giant anteater. I have learned a lot about the place and have loved this adventure, besides bringing back many photos as souvenirs.**
